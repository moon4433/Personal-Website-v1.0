        <p id="aboutme">
          At my core, I am a student through and through. I never stop learning.
          I tend to see something and want to try to replicate it or try to
          complete a random goal that I set out for myself. If I don't know
          something, I find out the information I am looking for. I am always
          prodding and the gates of knowledge hoping to be let in once again. To
          achieve, one must strive for greatness. So in my day-to-day life, I
          always try to improve who I am. And this example is shown throughout
          my work. So I hope you would take the time to take a look at my
          accomplishments.
        </p>

        <p id="aboutme">
          Secondly, I am a helper. I try to be that encouraging hand that is
          there to let you know that if you need the help, it is here ready to
          help. When I am helping someone, I feel like I accomplished something.
          I am always looking to lend a helping hand. I also like to fill in
          anywhere that new filling. Being helpful also show that one is useful,
          and I always appreciate being useful. This is also why I am always
          trying to learn and improve myself. Because the more useful I am, the
          more help I can provide to someone that needs it.
        </p>

        <p id="aboutme">
          Lastly, I am a geek. I not only learn how to improve my skills. I also
          learn to improve my gaming. Yes, yes I am a geek, nerd, game, what
          have you. But this is how I enjoy my time when I'm not learning
          something new or trying to help someone with something. But in a way,
          I am doing both those with all the team games I play... But I digress.
