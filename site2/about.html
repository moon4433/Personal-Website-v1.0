          <img src="img/site-one-image.jpg" id="funnyface" />On this page you
          will learn things that you didn't know about me, some things you did
          know about me, and probably things that you wish you didn't learn
          about me... Okay. That last one isn't true. But what is true is that
          this page is all about me, so read at your own volition. "Extra!
          Extra! Read all about the amazing and wonderful Keegan the
          magnificent. He can do anything you challenge him to do. If you need a
          helping hand, he'll be there. There is nothing that he can't do! You
          want him to move the moon, He'll do it! Want him to scale a
          skyscraper, he'll do that to. He can do the impossible!"... Too much?
          Okay. Well here is a summary of me.To be completely honest, there
          isn't much to me. I enjoy video games, watching tv, and hanging out
          with my friends. I am just another average joe. In high school, I
          found the joy of creating websites, and that passion wasn't sparked up
          again until I got into college. But once I picked it back up, I hit
          the ground rolling. I wanted to learn all that there was to make a
          website. Well, that was more daunting than I realized, but I am slowly
          getting better at it.I tend to be stubborn when it comes to learning
          something. I am not satisfied until I have what I want to learn down
          to the T. I want to be the best I can be, so that I may bring my
          skills to go help the world. Okay. The world maybe a little too big,
          but I do hope to help people. Whether it be through my work, or what I
          do. I hope to change someone's day for the better.

        <p id="aboutme3">
          At my core, I am a student through and through. I never stop learning.
          I tend to see something and want to try to replicate it or try to
          complete a random goal that I set out for myself. If I don't know
          something, I find out the information I am looking for. I am always
          prodding and the gates of knowledge hoping to be let in once again. To
          achieve, one must strive for greatness. So in my day-to-day life, I
          always try to improve who I am. And this example is shown throughout
          my work. So I hope you would take the time to take a look at my
          accomplishments.Secondly, I am a helper. I try to be that encouraging
          hand that is there to let you know that if you need the help, it is
          here ready to help. When I am helping someone, I feel like I
          accomplished something. I am always looking to lend a helping hand. I
          also like to fill in anywhere that new filling. Being helpful also
          show that one is useful, and I always appreciate being useful. This is
          also why I am always trying to learn and improve myself. Because the
          more useful I am, the more help I can provide to someone that needs
          it. Lastly, I am a geek. I not only learn how to improve my skills. I
          also learn to improve my gaming. Yes, yes I am a geek, nerd, game,
          what have you. But this is how I enjoy my time when I'm not learning
          something new or trying to help someone with something. But in a way,
          I am doing both those with all the team games I play... But I digress.

        <p id="aboutme3">
          I have lived in Grand Rapids all my life. Graduated highschool in
          2013. Got my associate's degree in 2016. Hopefully going to get my
          bacholars degree at the end of 2021. Working at the Ken's Fruit Market
          for 5 years now. Worked at Gravity Taphouse and Grille before that.
          Play video games and have a decent colection of them. I'm usually
          pretty quiet, but I do enjoy talkin also. Always trying to learn
          something new. But yeah!
